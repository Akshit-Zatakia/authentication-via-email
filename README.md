# OTP Authentication with JWT

## Overview
This application demonstrates a secure, passwordless authentication flow using **OTP (One-Time Password)** combined with **JWT (JSON Web Token)** and **Refresh Tokens**.

### What Does This Application Do?
- Sends an OTP to the user's email for authentication.
- Validates the OTP and generates a JWT access token and a refresh token.
- Supports refreshing access tokens using refresh tokens, ensuring long-term secure access.
- Implements **role-based access control (RBAC)**, enabling restricted access to specific APIs based on user roles.

This project is built using **Spring Boot** and demonstrates secure, modern, and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.

## Features
1. **Passwordless Authentication**: Login without remembering passwordsâ€”just use OTP sent to your email.
2. **JWT Tokens**: Secure access tokens to protect APIs and provide session-based authentication.
3. **Refresh Tokens**: Allows the user to get a new access token without re-entering the OTP.
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive APIs based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User).
5. **Email Integration**: Sends OTP via email using JavaMailSender.
